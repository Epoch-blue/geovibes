  target_description: |
    Palm oil processing mills typically have these characteristics:
    - Large industrial buildings/warehouses with metal roofs
    - Tall smokestacks or chimneys (often visible as shadows)
    - Settling ponds (rectangular or circular water features, often brown/orange colored)
    - Storage tanks (cylindrical structures)
    - Truck loading areas and access roads
    - Located in rural/agricultural areas surrounded by palm oil plantations
