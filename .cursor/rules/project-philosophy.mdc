# Geovibes Project Philosophy and Standards

## Core Principles
- Strictly follow the Zen of Python (PEP 20)
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts
- Flat is better than nested
- Sparse is better than dense

## Development Environment
- Default assumption: Working on GCP cloud VMs or Modal serverless compute
- Always ensure conda environment 'geovibes' is activated: `conda activate geovibes`
- Ask for clarification if deployment environment affects implementation

## Performance Focus
- Actively consider and implement parallelization for I/O-heavy tasks
- Use appropriate libraries (multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, asyncio, etc.)
- Design with cloud-scale performance in mind

## Path Handling
- Always use `os.path.join()`, `pathlib.Path`, or similar for path operations
- Never use string concatenation or manipulation for file paths
- Use platform-independent path handling

## Output Standards
- DO NOT generate explanatory markdown files after completing tasks
- DO NOT create README files unless explicitly requested
- DO NOT generate example or demo scripts after completing tasks
- Focus on delivering the requested functionality only
