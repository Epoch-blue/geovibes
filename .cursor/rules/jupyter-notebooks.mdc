# Jupyter Notebook Standards for Geovibes

## Notebook Structure and Organization
- Keep notebook cells focused and atomic
- Use markdown cells for section headers and explanations
- Import all required libraries in the first cell
- Never add inline comments unless explicitly requested
- Include progress logging for long-running operations

## Data Processing in Notebooks
- Implement parallel processing for I/O-heavy operations
- Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor` for concurrent tasks
- Display progress bars and timing information for long operations
- Always save intermediate results to avoid re-computation

## Integration with Geovibes Modules
- Reference main modules using relative imports: `sys.path.append('..')`
- Use functions from [tiling.py](mdc:geovibes/tiling.py) for MGRS operations
- Leverage existing utilities in [geovibes/](mdc:geovibes/) directory

## Memory Management and Performance
- Clear large variables when no longer needed using `del variable_name`
- Use `memory_usage(deep=True)` to monitor DataFrame memory consumption
- Process data in chunks for large datasets
- Implement sampling for visualization when datasets are too large

## Output and Results
- Create comprehensive summary statistics and visualizations
- Save results in multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, GeoParquet)
- Include data quality checks and validation
- Export combined datasets for further analysis

## Error Handling in Notebooks
- DO NOT use try/except blocks during development phases
- Use comprehensive logging instead: `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`
- Only add error handling when explicitly moving to production

## Environment Setup
- Always check conda environment: `conda activate geovibes`
- Configure logging at the beginning of notebooks
- Set random seeds for reproducibility when applicable
